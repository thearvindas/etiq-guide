<li>Follow the &ldquo;two-flight&rdquo; rule — if your destination is 2 floors above or below, don&rsquo;t get into the elevator. You can walk. Of course, there are exceptions to the rule — the elderly, parents with strollers, those with disabilities, and so on</li>
<li>If you&rsquo;re entering the elevator, wait until people who have to come out have done so</li>
<li>Respect personal space even in a confined space like an elevator:
<ul>
<li>If only 2 people are in the elevator, it’s best to stand on opposite sides of the car</li>
<li>3 to 4 people should gravitate toward each of the corners</li>
<li>5+ people should attempt to space themselves out evenly and face forward. Arms and hands should be kept at the sides to avoid contact</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>ALWAYS face the elevator door. Don&rsquo;t make things awkward by looking at someone right in the face</li>
<li>Don&rsquo;t play loud music, don&rsquo;t pick up a call while in the elevator</li>
<li>In a packed elevator, if you&rsquo;re at the front and someone at the back needs to exit, step out and give them the space to leave. Once they&rsquo;re out, you may head back inside</li>
</ul>
