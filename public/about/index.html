<meta name="twitter:description" content="Etiquette is about kindness, it is about being friendly, it is about being polite, it is about integrity, it is about good manners. It is the art of doing your part in making the world a better place for everyone else — through simple acts of kindness and discipline.
I&rsquo;ve found many instances where etiquette is thrown out the bus. It&rsquo;s not rare that you see folks cutting queues, folks with the sloppiest of table manners, and oh man, don&rsquo;t get me started on folks who are always late."/>

<p>I&rsquo;ve found many instances where etiquette is thrown out the bus. It&rsquo;s not rare that you see folks cutting queues, folks with the sloppiest of table manners, and oh man, don&rsquo;t get me started on folks who are <em>always</em> late.</p>
<p>I made this project to serve as a reminder/recap of certain etiquette I feel everyone should have.</p>
