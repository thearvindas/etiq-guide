That makes you rude and disrespectful If you&rsquo;re unavoidably running late, communicate it to all stakeholders, along with your ETA.

<li>Be respectful of others&rsquo; time. If you need some time with someone else, be precise and honest to how much you need, and stick to it</li>
<li>Delaying a meeting because of others’ lateness is highly rude and downright insulting to those who arrived on time to the meeting. What’s more, delaying a meeting instantly devalues the time of the people who are sitting right in front of you</li>
