- When at a small table of only two to four people, wait until everyone else has been served before starting to eat. At a formal or business meal, you should either wait until everyone is served to start or begin when the host asks you to
- Chew with your mouth closed. If you're conversing, pause until your food is down the gullet before speaking. Eat and listen, gulp down and then speak
- Use your napkin to wipe your mouth and fingers, especially if you are conversing with others
- Keep your phone on silent and wait until after your meal to check it
- Pace yourself at the speed of fellow diners
- Instead of reaching across the table for something, ask for it to be passed to you
  - If you are passing food around the table, always pass to the right (unless you are passing to a specific person)
