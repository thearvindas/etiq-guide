- First come, first serve is a general rule in door etiquette.  If you're the first to arrive at the door, it is your job to open and hold the door
- If you're with other people and have reached a door that *pulls* open, reach out and open it and continue to hold it open so that the people you're with may enter
- On a similar note, if you've reached a door that *pushes* open, push the door and head inside and continue to hold the door open as the others come inside
- If you see someone with arms full, needless to mention, you should offer to get the door for them
- Avoid the awkwardness of prematurely holding a door open for someone is a certain distance away as this might cause them to rush or hurry up
- NEVER allow a door to slam shut on someone
- When people visit your home, hold the door open as you invite guests to cross the threshold into your home.  And always walk guests to the door, opening it for them as you see them out
- When approaching someone's personal space (home/room/office):
  - If there is a bell -> press for 0.5 seconds and let go
  - If there is no bell -> knock firmly but gently 2-3 times
  - Don't enter without consent
- When at the doorstep, don't enter the owner's space without them asking you to
