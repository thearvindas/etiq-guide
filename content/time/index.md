- Please be on time. It's not cool when you're late. [When you show up 20 minutes late to something, you are saying that your time is worth more than my time. That you don’t care if you wasted 20 minutes of my time. That makes you rude and disrespectful](https://www.reddit.com/r/rant/comments/7wap92/being_late_all_the_time_isnt_quirky_or_part_of/)
- If you're unavoidably running late, communicate it to all stakeholders, along with your ETA. But even then, remember that [texting “Hey, I’m running 20 minutes late” is not as acceptable as making the effort to be on time](https://www.forbes.com/sites/robasghar/2014/04/22/27-etiquette-rules-for-our-times/?sh=74c692633dc3)
- Be respectful of others' time. If you need some time with someone else, be precise and honest to how much you need, and stick to it
- Delaying a meeting because of others’ lateness is highly rude and downright insulting to those who arrived on time to the meeting. What’s more, delaying a meeting instantly devalues the time of the people who are sitting right in front of you
