- Follow the "two-flight" rule — if your destination is 2 floors above or below, don't get into the elevator. You can walk. Of course, there are exceptions to the rule — the elderly, parents with strollers, those with disabilities, and so on
- If you're entering the elevator, wait until people who have to come out have done so
- Respect personal space even in a confined space like an elevator:
  - If only 2 people are in the elevator, it’s best to stand on opposite sides of the car
  - 3 to 4 people should gravitate toward each of the corners
  - 5+ people should attempt to space themselves out evenly and face forward. Arms and hands should be kept at the sides to avoid contact
- ALWAYS face the elevator door. Don't make things awkward by looking at someone right in the face
- Don't play loud music, don't pick up a call while in the elevator
- In a packed elevator, if you're at the front and someone at the back needs to exit, step out and give them the space to leave. Once they're out, you may head back inside
