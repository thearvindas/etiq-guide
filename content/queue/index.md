- Don't cut queues. It's not rocket science. It's not difficult to understand. Just don't cut queues. It's very disrespectful of people who've been waiting for much longer than you
- Exercise huge amounts of patience, even when the queue appears endless
- If you are holding a place for someone, explain to others around you to avoid conflict
- If someone appears like they are jumping the queue, politely correct them without getting into a squabble
 - Respect other peopleâ€™s space while on the queue
